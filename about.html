          <p class="card-text"> Online money transfer is the modern-day equivalent of wiring money: You can send someone money instantaneously simply by transferring money (or the data that represents that money) from you to another person. Usually involving little more than contact information -- such as a cell phone number or an e-mail address -- for the sending and receiving parties tied to a bank account, online money transfer can be done for a small fee from a secure, Web-based service via any computer with Internet access. There's no need to go to a money wiring office, telegraph station or even a bank.
            With the online money transfer franchise, you can become a local banker in your area and provide accessible banking and money transfer services. The Tatkal Money Transfer Agent can easily process the customer's request of sending money with an easy, convenient, and best money transfer application.
